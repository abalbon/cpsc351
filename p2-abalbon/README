Design of the Sleeping TA

Object and executable code not included in submission, in order to execute, it will need to be compiled again

How to compile:
1. In one terminal, go to the directory where the project file is located (in my case it is under a directory called
	p2-abalbon)
2. enter "make all"
	- This will compile the TA.cpp file
	- This will also take into account in linking -pthread library
	- if there is no make file included, simply enter: gcc -pthread TA.cpp
3. After compilation, an executable titled TASync will be creater
4. enter "./TASync"
	- This will execute the TA.cpp program
	- To enter a specific number of students simply add a number at the end of the command ie: ./TASync 4
5. The terminal will output the appropriate result.
6. To terminate the program, enter ctrl+c

Group Contribution
Prior to dividing our group into subgroups, we collaborated in determining the design of the process synchronization for
the sleeping Teaching Assistant program. We then divided into two different subgroups to figure out each function that was
within the TA.cpp file. Stephano and Tanis were primarily focused on the TA_Activity function and figuring out how the
TA processes were suppose to work. On the other hand Albert and Alisha focused their efforts on the Student_Activity and
how to manage each student thread. Everyone collaborated in the beginning during the design phase as well as completing the
main function of the cpp file where everything was declared and initialized
